## Overview

This project implements a range of bio-inspired optimization techniques that mimic natural phenomena like genetic evolution, swarm intelligence, and animal behavior. Each algorithm iteratively refines candidate solutions to solve complex computational problems.

## Algorithms

### Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- **Overview:** Evolves a population of solutions using natural selection mechanisms such as selection, crossover, and mutation.
- **Highlights:** Uses a fitness function (e.g., maximizing x²) to evaluate and guide evolution.
- **Applications:** General optimization, feature selection, pathfinding, and game strategy development.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- **Overview:** Simulates a swarm of particles that adjust their positions based on both personal and global best experiences.
- **Highlights:** Updates velocity and position to optimize functions (e.g., -x²).
- **Applications:** Function optimization, scheduling, and engineering design.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- **Overview:** Mimics the foraging behavior of ants by depositing pheromones to discover optimal paths, such as in the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- **Highlights:** Utilizes a distance matrix, pheromone updates, and heuristic guidance.
- **Applications:** Logistics, network optimization, and resource allocation.

### Cuckoo Search Optimization (CSO)
- **Overview:** Inspired by the brood parasitism behavior of cuckoos, using Lévy flights for effective global exploration.
- **Highlights:** Minimizes a quadratic function while maintaining solution diversity with an abandonment strategy.
- **Applications:** Continuous optimization, feature selection, and design optimization.

### Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)
- **Overview:** Emulates the social hierarchy and hunting strategies of grey wolves to perform optimization.
- **Highlights:** Balances exploration and exploitation via hierarchical position updates.
- **Applications:** Structural optimization, hyperparameter tuning, and engineering design.

### Parallel Cellular Algorithm (PCA)
- **Overview:** Inspired by cellular automata, where a grid of cells (solutions) evolves based on local interactions with neighboring cells.
- **Highlights:** Leverages parallel, neighborhood-based updates for high-dimensional continuous optimization.
- **Applications:** Data mining, clustering, resource allocation, and design optimization.

### Gene Expression Programming (GEP)
- **Overview:** Represents solutions as gene sequences that evolve through selection, crossover, and mutation, eventually expressing as mathematical formulas.
- **Highlights:** Combines genetic operations to convert gene tokens into a functional expression.
- **Applications:** Engineering design, hyperparameter tuning, pattern recognition, and resource scheduling.
